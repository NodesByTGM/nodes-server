# Nodes Server

Built with NodeJS + Typescript

### Starting up the Backend Server
Make a copy of `.env.example` and rename as `.env` and fill in the required secrets. <br/>
The `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is in this format: `key=value1,value2,...`

Simply run the following commands on your terminal

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
The server starts running as http://localhost:3001 or whatever port you've set it to listen to. Please ensure the DB is connected before any interactions.
